# Decoder-Ring Project

This is an App for encoding and decoding secret messages 3 different ways!
Use for fun and you can send messages to your friends or co workers.

**Name:** caesar

**How it Works:** Enter a message, a shift amount, and an encode or decode boolean.
              The function will shift each letter of the message over the shift amount (can be positive or negative)
              and output the new message depending on whether you used encode or decode.
          


**Name:** polybius

**How it Works:** Enter a message and an encode or decode boolean.
              Each letter is then represented by its coordinates in the grid. 
              The code is made up from a grid where the rows and columns are numbers and each square inside the table
              is a letter. So you use the numbers to make up the code to find what letter the message means.
              For example, "BAT" becomes "12 11 44". The 26 letters of the Latin/English alphabet do not fit in a 
              5 × 5 square, two letters must be combined (usually I and J as above, though C and K is an alternative). 
              Alternatively, a 6 × 6 grid may be used to allow numerals or special characters to be included as well 
              as letters.
             

**Name:** substitution

**How it Works:** A substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced 
              with the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key; the "units" may be single letters 
              (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver 
              deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution process to extract the original message. So a
              user can enter their own sustitution alphabet and their message 





## Goals

- Installing packages via NPM.
- Modifying the package.json file with new scripts.
- Running tests from the command line.
- Writing JavaScript functions.
- Writing tests for specific functions.
- Iterating through strings, objects, and arrays.
- Debugging through reading errors and using the VSCode debugger.

This was my first project where I had to write the tests out myself and I remember trying to think of every scenario that could happen and feeling lost about what tests I would actually need, but after some advice from my mentor I started small and simple, with just the ideal case and what I wanted from that, then slowly added more tests. I also remember having a really fun time writing these algorithms out and solving this puzzle.
## Tech Stack

**Tools:** Javascript, HTML, CSS

**Client:** HTML and CSS

**Server:** This file did not need to make any API calls and didn't need anything besides the functions themselves.
